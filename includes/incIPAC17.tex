\chapter{Data Acquisition and Controls Integration of the AWAKE Experiment at CERN}
\label{Pub:IPAC17}

\begin{hangparas}{10mm}{1}

    \textbf{Abstract:}
    The AWAKE experiment has been successfully installed in the CNGS facility at CERN, and is
    currently in its first stage of operation. The experiment seeks to demonstrate self-modulation
    of an SPS proton beam in a rubidium plasma, driving a wakefield of several gigavolt per meter.
    We describe the data acquisition and controls system of the AWAKE experiment, its integration
    into the CERN controls system and new control developments specifically required for the AWAKE
    experiment.
