\chapter{Loading of a Plasma-Wakefield Accelerator Section\\
         Driven by a Self-Modulated Proton Bunch}
\label{Pub:IPAC15}

\begin{hangparas}{10mm}{1}

    \textbf{Abstract:}
    We investigate beam loading of a plasma wake driven by a self-modulated proton beam using particle-in-cell
    simulations for phase III of the AWAKE project. We address the case of injection after the proton beam has already
    experienced self-modulation in a previous plasma. Optimal parameters for the injected electron bunch in terms of
    initial beam energy and beam charge density are investigated and evaluated in terms of witness bunch energy and
    energy spread. An approximate modulated proton beam is emulated in order to reduce computation time in these
    simulations.
