\chapter{Loading of Wakefields in a Plasma Accelerator Section\\ Driven by a Self-Modulated Proton Beam}
\label{Pub:NAPAC16}

\begin{hangparas}{10mm}{1}

    \textbf{Abstract:}
    Using parameters from the AWAKE project and particle-in-cell simulations we investigate beam loading of a plasma
    wake driven by a self-modulated proton beam. Addressing the case of injection of an electron witness bunch after the
    drive beam has already experienced self-modulation in a previous plasma, we optimise witness bunch parameters of
    size, charge and injection phase to maximise energy gain and minimise relative energy spread and emittance of the
    accelerated bunch.
