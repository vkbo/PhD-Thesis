\chapter{Data Acquisition and Controls Integration of the AWAKE Experiment at CERN}
\label{Pub:IPAC17}

\begin{hangparas}{10mm}{1}

    \textbf{Abstract:}
    The AWAKE experiment has been successfully installed in the CNGS facility at CERN, and is currently in its first
    stage of operation. The experiment seeks to demonstrate self-modulation of an SPS proton beam in a rubidium plasma,
    driving a wakefield of several gigavolt per meter. We describe the data acquisition and control system of the AWAKE
    experiment, its integration into the CERN control system and new control developments specifically required for
    AWAKE.
