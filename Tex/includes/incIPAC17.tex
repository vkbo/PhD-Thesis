    \item[Abstract:]
    The AWAKE experiment has been successfully installed in the CNGS facility at CERN, and is
    currently in its first stage of operation. The experiment seeks to demonstrate self-modulation
    of an SPS proton beam in a rubidium plasma, driving a wakefield of several gigavolt per meter.
    We describe the data acquisition and control system of the AWAKE experiment, its integration
    into the CERN control system and new control developments specifically required for AWAKE.
