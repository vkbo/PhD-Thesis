\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First of all I want to thank my thesis advisor Erik Adli who hired me and gave me the opportunity to join this exciting research project.
I would also like to thank Patric Muggli, my second thesis advisor, who I also got to share office with for a while.
I have learned a lot from you both.
Thanks to the AWAKE Collaboration for letting me be a part of the early stages of a truly interesting and challenging experiment, and see it through to its first year of operation.

The work presented in this thesis is mainly built on computer simulations.
Access to the simulation software OSIRIS was provided through Instituto Superior Técnico (IST) in Lisbon.
Thanks to Luís Silva for letting me visit several times, and to Jorge Vieira and Ligia Diana Amorim for our collaborations.
I enjoyed my time there, and I absolutely loved Lisbon.

The computing power was provided by the University of Oslo and the Norwegian Metacenter for Computational Science, using the \textit{Abel} computing cluster through project code \texttt{nn9303k}.

During the first year I got to spend a month and a half at the Stanford National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) in California, looking over the shoulders of the people running the FACET plasma wakefield experiment.
Thanks to Mark Hogan for letting me visit.
I enjoyed my brief time at FACET and spending time with the fantastic people working there.

I spent most of the last two years at CERN working directly with the CERN AWAKE group.
A big thank you to Helga Holmestad and Kyrre Sjøbæk for letting me spend almost four months in total in your guest room before I could move to CERN permanently and get my own place.
I also want to thank the AWAKE people at CERN -- Edda Gschwendtner, Marlene Turner and Alexey Petrenko -- for making me feel welcome there.

A special thank you to LGBTQ CERN and UN-GLOBE Geneva for being my friends and sparkly social network.
Anders, Mario, Alex, Laura, Tess, Ana, Xinyi, Noppadol, Pasqual, Nanoo, and all the others ... it wouldn't have been the same without you!

Finally, a big thank you to the High Energy Physics (EPF) section at the University of Oslo and for the many years I got to spend there through nine years of studies.

To all of you, mentioned or not: thanks for all the interesting discussions, drinks, nerding, as well as all the laughs.
It's been a blast.
So long, and thanks for all the fish!
