    \textbf{Abstract:}
    We investigate beam loading and emittance preservation for a high-charge electron beam being accelerated in
    quasi-linear plasma wakefield driven by a short proton beam. The structure of the wakefield is similar to that of a
    long, modulated proton beam. By selecting transverse and longitudinal electron beam parameters in order to
    appropriately load the wake, we show that the bulk of the electron beam can be accelerated without significant
    emittance growth.
