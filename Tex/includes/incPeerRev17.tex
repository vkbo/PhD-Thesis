    \textbf{Abstract:}
    We investigate beam loading and emittance preservation for a high-charge electron beam being
    accelerated in quasi-linear plasma wakefields driven by a short proton beam. The structure of
    the studied wakefields are similar to those of a long, modulated proton beam, such as the AWAKE
    proton driver. We show that by properly choosing the electron beam parameters and exploiting two
    well known effects, beam loading of the wakefield and full blow out of plasma electrons by the
    accelerated beam, the electron beam can gain large amounts of energy with a narrow final energy
    spread (\%-level) and without significant emittance growth.
