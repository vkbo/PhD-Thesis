\chapter*{Preface}

The work presented in this thesis is aimed towards addressing some of the questions surrounding the design of Run 2 of the AWAKE experiment at CERN (see Chapters \ref{Ch:Intro} and \ref{Ch:WFA}). It is published in the following four papers:

\begin{enumerate}[I]
    \item Loading of a Plasma-Wakefield Accelerator Section Driven by a Self-Modulated Proton Bunch, \emph{Proceedings of IPAC 2015} \cite{berglyd_olsen:2015}
    \item Loading of Wakefields in a Plasma Accelerator Section Driven by a Self-Modulated Proton Beam, \emph{Proceedings of NAPAC 2016} \cite{berglyd_olsen:2016}
    \item Data Acquisition and Controls Integration of the AWAKE Experiment at CERN, \emph{Proceedings of IPAC 2017} \cite{berglyd_olsen:2017}
    \item Emittance Preservation of an Electron Beam in a Loaded Quasilinear Plasma Wakefield, \emph{Physical Review Accelerators and Beams} \cite{berglyd_olsen:2018}
\end{enumerate}

The thesis also includes an introductory chapter outlining some of the core concepts involved in plasma wakefield acceleration techniques in Chapter \ref{Ch:Intro}. The AWAKE experiment itself is outlined in more detail in Chapter \ref{Ch:WFA}. The simulations forming the basis for the publications are described in Chapter \ref{Ch:Sim}, where the approximations used are also described. In Chapter \ref{Ch:DAQ} some of the additional work of integrating the AWAKE experiment with the CERN Control System is outlined. A final summary and conclusions are found in Chapter \ref{Ch:SnC}.

\noindent The four publications are included in this thesis in an appendix titled \hyperref[A:Pub]{Publications}. Additional appendices outlining the principles of Particle in Cell codes used in this work, and the analysis code written, are also included.
