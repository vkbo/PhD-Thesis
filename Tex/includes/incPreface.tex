\chapter*{Preface}

Plasma wakefield accelerators are very complex machines, and there are many parameters to tweak in order to accelerate a particle bunch to high energies, while retaining its quality in terms of energy spread and emittance.
What practical application such accelerators may have depends on exactly what these parameters end up being, and how they depend on each other.
It is entirely possible that plasma wakefield accelerators may not produce the beam quality needed for the frontier particle physics experiments of the future.
As Terry Pratchett once said: \textit{It is well known that a vital ingredient of success is not knowing that what you're attempting can't be done}~\cite{pratchett:1987}.
That does not mean they may not be useful in other areas, like for instance for medical applications or for other types of research.
In addition, understanding how charged particle bunches interact with plasmas is interesting on its own, and may lead to other applications not yet considered.
The strong focusing forces produced by plasmas under certain conditions can be utilised by for instance plasma lenses~\cite{su:1990}, and hollow electron channels can be used for beam collimation~\cite{stancari:2014}.

Computer simulations are useful when trying to understand complex systems where many factors interact.
They can be used to find and study ideal cases, or they can be used to replicate experiments in order to better understand what is going on when you cannot measure all the parameters within the experiment itself.
The work presented in this thesis is aimed towards addressing some of the questions surrounding the design of Run~2 of the AWAKE experiment at CERN (see Chapters~\ref{Ch:Intro} and~\ref{Ch:WFA}).
While the current Run~1 addresses some of the principle properties of a proton driven plasma wakefield accelerator, like the interaction between the plasma and the bunch itself, how the wakefields evolve, and how a sample of electrons behave in such a wakefield, Run~2 aims to accelerate a narrow, short electron bunch to high energies while retaining a low energy spread and low emittance.

This thesis includes an introduction outlining some of the core concepts involved in plasma wakefield acceleration techniques in Chapter~\ref{Ch:Intro}.
The AWAKE experiment itself is covered in more detail in Chapter~\ref{Ch:WFA}.
In Chapter~\ref{Ch:DAQ} some of the additional work of integrating the AWAKE experiment with the CERN Control System is outlined.
The simulations forming the basis for the publications are described in Chapters~\ref{Ch:SimS} and~\ref{Ch:SimA}, where the approximations used are also described.
A final summary and conclusion is found in Chapter~\ref{Ch:SnC}.

The four publications are included in this thesis in an appendix titled \hyperref[A:Pub]{Publications}.
Additional appendices outlining the principles of Particle in Cell codes used in this work, and a description of the analysis code written for the simulations are also included.
