\chapter{A Wakefield Accelerator Experiment}
\label{Ch:WFA}

AWAKE is the first proton driven wakefield accelerator experiment in the world. It is a proof-of-concept experiment aiming to inform a design for future high energy accelerators \cite{gschwendtner:2016}. The proton drive beam is delivered by the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN at an energy of $400\unit{GeV}$. AWAKE is physically located at the former site of the CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso experiment (CNGS) \cite{gschwendtner:2010} in a tunnel below the Swiss-French border and connected to the SPS at SPS Point 4. The placement of the AWAKE experiment in relation to the rest of the CERN accelerator complex can be seen in Figure \ref{Fig:WFA:AccComp}.

\section{Evolution of the Concept}
\label{WFA:History}

While AWAKE is the first proton driven wakefield experiment, a number of experiments with electron drive beams have confirmed the models produced by theory and simulations. The first experimental results of plasma wakefield acceleration were published in 1988. The experiment was conducted at the Advanced Accelerator Test Facility at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) outside Chicago, USA \cite{rosenzweig:1988}.

\section{AWAKE: A Design Overview}
\label{WFA:Design}

AWAKE is, as of the writing of this thesis, operational and in Run 1. The proton beam line arriving from the SPS joins with the laser beam, and the electron beam line, and connects to a $10\unit{m}$ plasma stage. In addition, an electron source has been installed, and a new side tunnel had to be dug to fit the electron beam line connecting the source to the main assembly. Figure \ref{Fig:WFA:AWAKE} gives and overview of the experimental layout in the tunnel. The old CNGS target is still present, behind a shielding wall as it is highly radioactive. This, unfortunately, has created some constraints for fitting the downstream beam line and diagnostics, and may pose additional challenges for Run 2.

\subsection{Plasma Source}
\label{WFA:Design:Plasma}

The requirements for the plasma source for AWAKE Run 1 were a $10\unit{m}$ long cell with a plasma electron density range of $1-10\nexp{14}\unit{cm}^{-3}$. The density variation should be within $0.2\%$, and the radius of the plasma channel should be $\geq 1\unit{mm}$. The plasma should also consist of heavy ions to mitigate ion motion \cite{caldwell:2015}.

    \caption{\label{Fig:WFA:PlasmaCell} A CAD drawing of the plasma cell and its related components, as presented in the 2016 AWAKE Status Report \cite{awake_collaboration:2016}.}
\end{figure}

For the AWAKE vapour source, rubidium (Rb) was chosen. Rubidium has a low melting point, $39.3\celsius$; a low first ionisation energy, $4.18\unit{eV}$; and a standard atomic weight of $85.47$. The plasma wavelength of rubidium ions with a $+1$ charge is roughly $400$ times that of the plasma electrons (see Eq. \ref{EQ:PWFA:L0W0}), preventing significant ion motion for AWAKE application \cite{vieira:2012a}. An additional benefit of using an alkaline metal like rubidium is that the second ionisation level is significantly higher, $27.3\unit{eV}$, making it relatively easy to prevent further ionisation and thus a lower charge/mass ratio \cite{awake_collaboration:2017}. The rubidium vapour is created by heating the reservoir and the plasma cell to around $150-230\celsius$ to reach the density range required for AWAKE \cite{caldwell:2015,muggli:2017a}.

The ionisation of the Rb vapour is achieved with a short laser pulse co-propagating with the proton drive beam. The laser can be timed such that the plasma channel is created inside the beam itself. The short laser pulse produces a sharp plasma edge that provides a good seed for the self-modulation instability \cite{vieira:2014a}. The section of the proton beam ahead of the laser does not interact strongly with the neutral rubidium vapour, although a low level of impact ionisation does occur. However, this effect is not significant \cite{awake_collaboration:2017}.

The ionisation laser used for AWAKE is a $780\unit{nm}$ Ti:Sapphire laser with a pulse length of $120\unit{fs}$ and a maximum compressed energy of $450\unit{mJ}$. The peak intensity is around $1.2\nexp{14}\unit{W/cm}^{2}$, with a spot size radius of $1\unit{mm}$ \cite{awake_collaboration:2017}. The appearance intensity needed for ionisation of rubidium is around $1.7\nexp{12}\unit{W/cm}^{2}$ \cite{augst:1989}. Ionisation of a second electron requires some $455$ times higher intensity, so we expect no secondary ionisation \cite{muggli:2017a}.

\subsection{Electron Source}
\label{WFA:Design:ESource}

The AWAKE electron source needed for Run 1 consists of a $2.5$ cell RF-gun and a $1\unit{m}$ long booster structure, both operating at $3\unit{GHz}$, a cathode transfer chamber, beam diagnostics, and a beam transport line connecting it to the proton beam line. The beam is boosted to up to $20\unit{MeV}$ by a constant gradient acceleration structure. The RF-gun and the booster are powered by a $30\unit{MW}$ klystron \cite{awake_collaboration:2017,pepitone:2016}. Several of the components, including the RF-gun and klystron, were re-purposed from the former PHIN injector in the CLIC test facility \cite{chevallay:2012}. An overview of the electron source and the accelerating structure can be seen in Figure \ref{Fig:WFA:ESource}.
