\chapter{Introduction}
\label{Ch:Intro}

Accelerating particle beams in a plasma is an attractive concept as plasmas are capable of sustaining significantly higher accelerating fields than conventional RF structures. Conventional RF structures suffers electrical breakdowns at very high electric fields, and these breakdowns can over time damage the accelerator structures \cite{braun:2003}. This puts an upper limit on the accelerating gradient of around $350$ to $400\unit{MV/m}$, although in practice the upper limit is determined by the statistical probability of a breakdown and the acceptable number of breakdowns in a given period of time \cite{pritzkau:2002}.

\section{Plasma Wakefield Acceleration}
\label{Int:PWFA}

The two main techniques for producing strong accelerating fields in plasmas are by the use of an intense laser beam, or by the use of a particle drive beam. Laser accelerator techniques were investigated in the 1970s both theoretically \cite{chan:1971,palmer:1972} and through the use of computer simulations \cite{tajima:1979}. Using particle beams to drive accelerating wakefields were proposed some time later, in 1985 \cite{chen:1985}.

\subsection{Beam Driven}
\label{Int:PDPWFA}

The principles behind beam driven plasma wakefield acceleration (PDPWFA) were formulated in the 1980s by Pisin Chen \emph{et al.} \cite{chen:1985}. Conceptually, the technique involves a beam of particles called the drive beam, travelling through a plasma of a given density. The beam generates strong longitudinal and transverse electric fields in its wake, of witch a trailing beam of particles draws energy in order to accelerate \dash thus we see a transfer of energy from one beam to another through plasma as the intermediate medium.

The trailing fields have a periodic structure determined by the plasma frequency, $\omega_{pe}$, and wavelength, $\lambda_{pe}$; given as
\begin{align}
    \lambda_{pe} = \frac{2\pi c}{\omega_{pe}}, \quad \omega_{pe} = \sqrt{\frac{n_{0}e^{2}}{m_{e}\epsilon_{0}}}, \label{EQ:PWFA:L0W0}
\end{align}
where $n_{0}$ is the initial plasma electron density, $e$ is the elementary charge, $m_{e}$ is the electron mass, and $\epsilon_{0}$ is the vacuum permittivity.

It has been shown experimentally that energy can be transferred from one or two electron drive beams to a single electron witness beam \cite{rosenzweig:1988, blumenfeld:2007, kallos:2008, litos:2014}. A limitation using an electron beams with a similar initial charge and energy for both drive and witness beam is that the witness beam will rapidly gain energy while the drive beam loses energy. This causes the witness beam to catch up with the drive beam, and the acceleration stops.

\subsection{The Linear Regime}
\label{Int:PWFA:Lin}

A point like charge travelling at a speed close to the speed of light, will generate fields in its wake \cite{van_der_meer:1985,chen:1985}:
\begin{align}
    E_{z} &= -\frac{Q_{b}k_{pe}^{2}}{2\pi\epsilon_{0}} K_{0}(k_{pe}r)\cos(k_{pe}z - \omega_{pe}t) \label{EQ:PWFA:EZ} \\
    E_{r} &= \hphantom{-} \frac{Q_{b}k_{pe}^{2}}{2\pi\epsilon_{0}} K_{1}(k_{pe}r)\sin(k_{pe}z - \omega_{pe}t), \label{EQ:PWFA:ER}
\end{align}
where $Q_{b}$ is the charge of the beam, $k_{pe}$ is the plasma wave number, and $K_{0}$ and $K_{1}$ are modified Bessel functions.
