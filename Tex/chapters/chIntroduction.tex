\chapter{Introduction}
\label{Ch:Intro}

Accelerating a particle beam in a plasma is an attractive concept because the plasma itself is
capable of sustaining significantly higher accelerating fields than conventional RF structures.
Conventional RF structures suffers electrical breakdowns at very high electric fields, and these
breakdowns can over time damage the accelerator structures \cite{braun:2003}. This puts an upper
limit on the accelerating gradient of around $350$ to $400\unit{MV/m}$. The practical upper limit is
however determined by the statistical probability of a breakdown and the acceptable number of
breakdowns in a given period of time.\cite{pritzkau:2002}

\section{Plasma Wakefield Acceleration}
\label{Int:PWFA}

The principles behind plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA) were formulated in the 1980s by Pisin
Chen \emph{et al.} \cite{chen:1985}. Conceptually, the technique involves a beam of particles called
the drive beam, travelling through a plasma of a given density. The beam generates strong
longitudinal and transverse electric fields in its wake, of witch a trailing beam of particles draws
energy in order to accelerate \dash thus we see a transfer of energy from one beam to another
through plasma as the intermediate medium.

The trailing fields have a periodic structure determined by the plasma frequency, $\omega_{pe}$, and
wavelength, $\lambda_{pe}$; given as \begin{align} \lambda_{pe} = \frac{2\pi c}{\omega_{pe}}, \quad
\omega_{pe} = \sqrt{\frac{n_{0}e^{2}}{m_{e}\epsilon_{0}}}, \label{EQ:PWFA:L0W0} \end{align} where
$n_{0}$ is the initial plasma electron density, $e$ is the elementary charge, $m_{e}$ is the
electron mass, and $\epsilon_{0}$ is the vacuum permittivity.

It has been shown experimentally that energy can be transferred from one or two electron drive beams
to a single electron witness beam \cite{rosenzweig:1988, blumenfeld:2007, kallos:2008}. A limitation
using an electron beams with a similar initial charge and energy for both drive and witness beam is
that the witness beam will rapidly gain energy while the drive beam loses energy. This causes the
witness beam to catch up with the drive beam, and the acceleration stops.

\subsection{The Linear Regime}
\label{Int:PWFA:Lin}

A point like charge travelling at a speed close to the speed of light, will generate fields in its
wake \cite{van_der_meer:1985,chen:1985}:
\begin{align}
    E_{z} &=            - \frac{Q_{b}k_{pe}^{2}}{2\pi\epsilon_{0}} K_{0}(k_{pe}r)\cos(k_{pe}z - \omega_{pe}t)
                          \label{EQ:PWFA:EZ} \\
    E_{r} &= \hphantom{-} \frac{Q_{b}k_{pe}^{2}}{2\pi\epsilon_{0}} K_{1}(k_{pe}r)\sin(k_{pe}z - \omega_{pe}t),
                          \label{EQ:PWFA:ER}
\end{align}
where $Q_{b}$ is the charge of the beam, $k_{pe}$ is the plasma wave number, and $K_{0}$ and $K_{1}$
are modified Bessel functions.
