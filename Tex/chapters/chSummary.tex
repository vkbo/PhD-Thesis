\chapter{Summary and Conclusion}
\label{Ch:SnC}

In Run~1 of AWAKE, which saw first beam in December 2016, the experiment sought to probe the wakefields generated by the SPS proton bunch in a $10\unit{m}$ Rubidium plasma stage.
This was done with a wide and long electron witness bunch capable of probing the entire phase of one plasma wavelength and a significant fraction of the radial extent of the accelerating fields.

As of the writing of this thesis, AWAKE Run~1 enters its final few months of operation.
The results of the run have been exciting, with self-modulation confirmed and studied, and $2\unit{GeV}$ accelerated electrons seen~\cite{adli:2018}.

The aim of this thesis project was to study the performance of an optimised electron witness bunch in a proton driven plasma wakefield accelerator section.
The study was specifically aimed at Run~2 of the AWAKE experiment, scheduled after the 2019--2020 Long Shutdown~2 of the LHC, with construction planned for the shutdown period.

First we studied how much charge, and with what bunch size, electrons could be accelerated in AWAKE Run~2.
The aim was to maximise charge and acceleration, while minimising energy spread.
This was presented in Publication~\ref{Pub:NAPAC16}.
The results of the scan are shown in Figure~\ref{Fig:SimA:NAPACPD}, and show that bunches with a $\sigma_z = 40-60\unit{\mu m}$ can be accelerated without too much energy spread and at a low cost of loss of final energy.
That is, the loading of the field is just enough to make it nearly flat over the length of the bunch while not lowering the average strength of the wakefield in the same region.

Continuing from this, the emittance evolution in the wake was studied using a quasi-static simulation code using the same range of parameters.
We identified a new regime for plasma wakefield acceleration: the quasi-linear regime with witness bunch beam loading.
The beam loading creates an emittance preserving accelerating bubble, opening up for emittance preservation of an electron bunch in proton-driven plasma wakefield accelerators.
Figure~\ref{Fig:Sum:BQ} from Publication~\ref{Pub:BL17} shows the parameter space where good emittance preservation is observed.
$\tilde{Q}$ is defined as the fraction of the bunch charge that sees a emittance growth $\leq 5\%$, laid out in Section~\ref{SimA:QTilde}.
In excess of $70\%$ of the bunch can be accelerated without any significant emittance growth, while the rest of the bunch is used to drive the non-linear region.

Again, the $\sigma_z = 40-60\unit{\mu m}$ range performs well in that we see a flattening of the accelerating wakefield without overloading it until we reach high charges, $> 150-200\unit{pC}$.
The different size bunches have their energy spread minima at $\approx 50\unit{pC}$ and $\approx 100\unit{pC}$, respectively.

The simulations indicate that with these parameters, and under the assumption that the witness bunch is injected on the same axis as the drive bunch, $30-70\unit{pC}$ of electrons can be accelerated without emittance growth and with a $\lesssim 2\%$ energy spread.

Some emittance growth is inevitable due to the quasi-linear regime in which AWAKE operates.
However, this growth is localised to the head of the witness bunch, while the bunch itself drives wakefields putting its own tail in the non-linear regime where no significant emittance growth occurs.

Whether these conditions are reproducible in AWAKE Run~2 remains to be seen.
Alignment of the two bunches is certainly a challenge, and Publication~\ref{Pub:BL17} shows that some tolerance exists in terms of witness bunch offset, but with a cost to emittance preservation.
