	abstract = {Abstract A practical step-by-step guide to wavelet analysis is given, with examples taken from time series of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation ({ENSO}). The guide includes a comparison to the windowed Fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and Fourier frequency. New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. Empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals. Extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power Hovmöller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described. The statistical significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of changes in {ENSO} variance on interdecadal timescales. Using new datasets that extend back to 1871, the Niño3 sea surface temperature and the Southern Oscillation index show significantly higher power during 1880–1920 and 1960–90, and lower power during 1920–60, as well as a possible 15-yr modulation of variance. The power Hovmöller of sea level pressure shows significant variations in 2–8-yr wavelet power in both longitude and time.},

Important similarities and differences between a free electron laser ({FEL}) and an {ICL} are delineated. It is shown that the frequency of spontaneous radiation is a strong function of the betatron strength parameter aβ, which plays a role similar to that of the wiggler strength parameter in a conventional {FEL}. For aβ≳1, radiation is emitted in numerous harmonics. Furthermore, aβ is proportional to the amplitude of the betatron orbit, which varies for every electron in the beam. The radiation spectrum emitted from an electron beam is calculated by averaging the single-electron spectrum over the electron distribution. This leads to a frequency broadening of the radiation spectrum, which places serious limits on the possibility of realizing an {ICL}.},

	abstract = {The energy frontier of particle physics is several trillion electron volts, but colliders capable of reaching this regime (such as the Large Hadron Collider and the International Linear Collider) are costly and time-consuming to build; it is therefore important to explore new methods of accelerating particles to high energies. Plasma-based accelerators are particularly attractive because they are capable of producing accelerating fields that are orders of magnitude larger than those used in conventional colliders. In these accelerators, a drive beam (either laser or particle) produces a plasma wave (wakefield) that accelerates charged particles. The ultimate utility of plasma accelerators will depend on sustaining ultrahigh accelerating fields over a substantial length to achieve a significant energy gain. Here we show that an energy gain of more than 42 {GeV} is achieved in a plasma wakefield accelerator of 85 cm length, driven by a 42 {GeV} electron beam at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center ({SLAC}). The results are in excellent agreement with the predictions of three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Most of the beam electrons lose energy to the plasma wave, but some electrons in the back of the same beam pulse are accelerated with a field of 52 {GV} m-1. This effectively doubles their energy, producing the energy gain of the 3-km-long {SLAC} accelerator in less than a metre for a small fraction of the electrons in the injected bunch. This is an important step towards demonstrating the viability of plasma accelerators for high-energy physics applications.},

	abstract = {A nonlinear kinetic theory for multidimensional plasma wave wakes with phase velocities near the speed of light is presented. This theory is appropriate for describing plasma wakes excited in the so-called blowout regime by either electron beams or laser pulses where the plasma electrons move predominantly in the transverse direction. The theory assumes that all electrons within a blowout radius are completely expelled. These radially expelled electrons form a narrow sheath just beyond the blowout radius which is surrounded by a region which responds weakly (linearly). This assumption is reasonable when the spot size of the electron beam and laser are substantially less than the blowout radius. By using this theory one can predict the wakefield amplitudes and blowout radius in terms of the electron beam or laser beam parameters, as well as predict the nonlinear modifications to the wake’s wavelength and wave form. For the laser case, the laser spot size must also be properly matched in order for a narrow sheath to form. The requirements for forming a spherical wave form, i.e., “bubble,” are also discussed. The theory is also used to show when linear fluid theory breaks down and how this leads to a saturation of the logarithmic divergence in the linear Green’s function.},

Developed in Fortran 90, the code runs on multiple platforms (Cray T3E, {IBM} {SP}, Mac clusters) and can be easily ported to new ones. Details on the code’s capabilities are given. We discuss the object-oriented design of the code, the encapsulation of system dependent code and the parallelization of the algorithms involved. We also discuss the implementation of communications as a boundary condition problem and other key characteristics of the code, such as the moving window, open-space and thermal bath boundaries, arbitrary domain decomposition, 2D (cartesian and cylindric) and 3D simulation modes, electron sub-cycling, energy conservation and particle and field diagnostics. Finally results from three-dimensional simulations of particle and laser wakefield accelerators are presented, in connection with the data analysis and visualization infrastructure developed to post-process the scalar and vector results from {PIC} simulations.},

	abstract = {We study the physics of self-modulation instability ({SMI}) of long, when compared to the wake wavelength, electron and positron bunches in pre-formed plasmas at {SLAC}-{FACET}. Self-modulation is the result of the action of focusing/defocusing transverse wakefields on the bunch radius. Self-modulation leads to observables such as overall defocusing of the bunch, periodic modulation of the bunch radius at the wake period and multi-{GeV} energy gain/loss by drive bunch particles. Defocusing is observed from {OTR} images, radial self-modulation from {CTR} spectra and interferometric traces and energy gain/loss from energy spectra with sub-{GeV} resolution. The plasma density is varied by changing the vapor density ionized by a laser/axicon system. The bunch length, radius and charge can also be varied. The {SMI} can be seeded using a notch collimator system. Numerical simulations indicate that seeding the {SMI} mitigates the hose instability. Hose instability can also be seeded, for example by using the {RF} deflecting cavity to impart a tilt to the incoming bunch axis. The overall experimental plan as well as the latest experimental results obtained with electron bunches will be presented.},

Trapping occurs in the transition regions of a Li plasma confined by He gas. Li plasma electrons support the wake, and higher ionization potential He atoms are ionized as the beam is focused by Li ions and can be trapped. As the wake amplitude is increased, the onset of trapping is observed. Some electrons gain up to 7.6 {GeV} in a 30.5 cm plasma. The experimentally inferred trapping threshold is at a wake amplitude of 36 {GV}/m, in good agreement with an analytical model and {PIC} simulations.},

Analytical solutions for the fields and the shape of the ion channel are derived. It is shown that very high beam-loading efficiency can be achieved, while the energy spread of the bunch is conserved. The theoretical results are verified with the particle-in-cell code {OSIRIS}.},

Past research has focused on creating large-amplitude plasma waves by injecting an intense laser pulse or an electron bunch into the plasma. However, the maximum energy gain of electrons accelerated in a single plasma stage is limited by the energy of the driver. Proton bunches are the most promising drivers of wakefields to accelerate electrons to the {TeV} energy scale in a single stage. An experimental program at {CERN}—the {AWAKE} experiment—has been launched to study in detail the important physical processes and to demonstrate the power of proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration. Here we review the physical principles and some experimental considerations for a future proton-driven plasma wakefield accelerator.},

It is appropriate for describing plasma waves excited when all electrons are expelled out from a finite region by either the space charge of a short electron beam or the radiation pressure of a short intense laser. It works very well for the first bucket before phase mixing occurs. We separate the plasma response into a cavity or blowout region void of all electrons and a sheath of electrons just beyond the cavity. This simple model permits the derivation of a single equation for the boundary of the cavity. It works particularly well for narrow electron bunches and for short lasers with spot sizes matched to the radius of the cavity. It is also used to describe the structure of both the accelerating and focusing fields in the wake.},

This theory shows how to choose the charge, the shape, and the placing of the bunch so that the conversion efficiency from the fields of the bubble to the accelerating electrons reaches nearly 100\% and the beam quality is optimized. For intense drivers the nonlinear wake is described by the shape of the bubble and beam loading arises when the radial space-charge force of the beam acts back on the electron sheath surrounding the ion channel. The modification of the wake due to the presence of flat-top electron bunches is studied and it is shown that the energy spread of an externally injected flat-top electron bunch can be kept low. The bunch profile that leads to zero energy spread is also derived.},
