	abstract = {We investigate beam loading of a plasma wake driven by a self-modulated proton beam using particle-in-cell simulations for phase III of the AWAKE project. We address the case of injection after the proton beam has already experienced self-modulation in a previous plasma. Optimal parameters for the injected electron bunch in terms of initial beam energy and beam charge density are investigated and evaluated in terms of witness bunch energy and energy spread. An approximate modulated proton beam is emulated in order to reduce computation time in these simulations.},

Addressing the case of injection of an electron witness bunch after the drive beam has already experienced self-modulation in a previous plasma, we optimise witness bunch parameters of size, charge and injection phase to maximise energy gain and minimise relative energy spread and emittance of the accelerated bunch.},
