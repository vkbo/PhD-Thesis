We address the case of injection after the proton beam has already experienced self-modulation in a previous plasma. Optimal parameters for the injected electron bunch in terms of initial beam energy and beam charge density are investigated and evaluated in terms of witness bunch energy and energy spread. An approximate modulated proton beam is emulated in order to reduce computation time in these simulations.},

	title = {Avoiding vacuum arcs in high gradient normal conducting {RF} structures},
	url = {https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/52944},
	abstract = {In order to build the Compact LInear Collider (CLIC), accelerating structures reaching extremely high accelerating gradients are needed. Such structures have been built and tested using normal-conducting copper, powered by X-band RF power and reaching gradients of 100 MV/m and above. One phenomenon that must be avoided in order to reliably reach such gradients, is vacuum arcs or “breakdowns”. This can be accomplished by carefully designing the structure geometry such that high surface fields and large local power flows are avoided.
The research presented in this thesis presents a method for optimizing the geometry of accelerating structures so that these breakdowns are made less likely, allowing the structure to operate reliably at high gradients. This was done primarilly based on a phenomenological scaling model, which predicted the maximum gradient as a function of the break down rate, pulse length, and field distribution in the structure. The model is written in such a way that it allows direct comparison of different criteria, i.e. the peak electric field, the peak local power flow or “modified Poynting vector” Sc, and the global power flow per iris circumference. Using this method, a set of highly optimized accelerating cells were created, as was a C++ library capable of estimating the performance of an RF structure based on these accelerating cells. This library was used in the rebaselinging of the CLIC machine.
In addition to this, the thesis also presents a particle in cell simulation of the initial stages of a vacuum arc. This model follows the development of the arc from a small field emitter into a multi-ampere discharge, tracking the evolution of the plasma and the circuit, as well as the interaction between the plasma and the surface. From this model, our understanding of the importance of the ion bombardment under the plasma sheath was improved, especially the ion energy distribution and its effect on sputtering vs. the effective sputtering yields required for the arc to sustain itself and grow.},

	abstract = {When the thermal stresses induced by rf pulsed heating are larger than the elastic limit, microcracks and surface roughening will occur due to cyclic fatigue. Therefore, pulsed heating limits the maximum surface magnetic field and through it the maximum achievable accelerating gradient. An experiment using circularly cylindrical cavities operating in the TE011 mode at a resonant frequency of 11.424 GHz was designed to study pulsed heating on oxygen free electronic (OFE) copper. An X-band klystron delivered up to 10 MW to the cavities in 1.5 μs pulses at 60 Hz repetition rate. One run was executed at a temperature rise of 120 K for 56×106 pulses. Cracks at grain boundaries, slip bands, and cracks associated with these slip bands were observed. The second run consisted of 86×106 pulses with a temperature rise of 82 K, and cracks at grain boundaries and slip bands were seen. Additional information can be derived from the power-coupling iris, and we conclude that a pulsed temperature rise of 250 K for several million pulses leads to destruction of copper. These results can be applied to any mode of any OFE copper cavity.},

	abstract = {A TeV-range e+e− linear collider has emerged as one of the most promising candidates to extend the high energy frontier of experimental elementary particle physics. A high accelerating gradient for such a collider is desirable to limit its overall length. Accelerating gradient is mainly limited by electrical breakdown, and it has been generally assumed that this limit increases with increasing frequency for normal-conducting accelerating structures. Since the choice of frequency has a profound influence on the design of a linear collider, the frequency dependence of breakdown has been measured using six exactly scaled single-cell cavities at 21, 30, and 39 GHz. The influence of temperature on breakdown behavior was also investigated. The maximum obtainable surface fields were found to be in the range of 300 to 400 MV/m for copper, with no significant dependence on either frequency or temperature.},
